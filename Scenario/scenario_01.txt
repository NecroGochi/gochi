[Gochi]Where am I? What am I doing here? A moment ago...
[...]Exactly.
[Gochi](Ah. I know this feeling. It isn't first time. So I am...)
[Gochi]...your clone, D.
[D]Nice, 10 points to Gochi. That means to me.
[D]I am moved, when I remember the beginnings. Finding out who was who, was annoying.
[D]Gochi. To be sure. What is your purpose of your existence and your current task.
[Gochi]My purpose is gather souls of might heroes to create from them books of memories.
[Gochi]My first task is... go to the bed.
[D]Wrong. We know each other too well. You can't escape it.
[Gochi](I'm right.)
[D]What is your task at that moment?
[Gochi]Cleaning up this part of library and killing the monsters here.
[D]Finally. Now go to work.
