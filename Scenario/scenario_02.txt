[Gochi]Finally I've finished. I hate myself.
[D]Why? You've made a good job here.
[Gochi]I hate bugs. D@&&*t, someone should kill you already.
[Gochi]You purposely erased memories of it. That same goes for dogs and other abominations.
[D]You know, otherwise you wouldn't be doing it.
[Gochi]Why have the book appeared?
[D]It must have been angry at me for not taking care of this place.
[Gochi]I hope you burn in hell.
[D]I doubt. You have deserved a rest. You can go for souls whenever you want.
[Gochi]Is there anything else you haven't told me or erased?
[D]It's secret.
[Gochi]You like to watch another you suffer.
[D]You know answer. Bye.
